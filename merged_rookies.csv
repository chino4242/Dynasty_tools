He is described as being as good as it gets, with the size to handle a large workload. His best season in prorated reception share is sixth-best in the ZAP model’s history, and his Breakout Score is 94.3.    

He is one of six players in the model’s database to have a best season total yards per team play above 2.8. There is a possibility that Boise State’s strength of schedule inflated Jeanty’s numbers, but that will be reflected in his draft capital.    

Finding statistical comparisons for Jeanty is difficult, as there hasn’t been a prospect like him since 2011.

His comparisons to Drake London don’t work well analytically, as London had a much better age-adjusted profile. London's Breakout Score was elite.

Burden ran roughly 83% of his routes from the slot while at Missouri. He only has one great season of production; his sophomore campaign was impressive, but his rates were below 2.0 in his Freshman and Junior seasons. He didn’t do typical wide receiver things during his big Sophomore year.

As a Freshman at Ohio State, Henderson ran the ball 183 times for 1,248 yards and 15 touchdowns.  He also caught 27 passes for 312 yards and 4 more touchdowns.    

That Freshman-season production led to an 86.4 Breakout Score for Henderson, the seventh-best mark in the class.    

Henderson is getting knocked down a tad in the model because he had a best-season reception share of just 9.7%.  That ranks 20th out of the 31 running backs who were invited to the combine this year.    

In the ZAP Model database, there’ve only been five running backs with a best-season reception share below 10% and a Breakout Score above 80.    

Effectively, this is telling us that Henderson was really good once he got the ball in his hands.    

There may be some questions about his potential ground-game workload at the next level.  Henderson maxed out at 183 rush attempts in a single season at Ohio State.

That was by far the highest of his career, with his second-best season coming in 2024 at 2.22. It’s impressive that Egbuka was able to do that at a young age alongside strong competition.    

Injuries played a role in the dip from his Sophomore campaign. Egbuka had ankle and knee problems in 2023, so he wasn’t able to keep the momentum going from his wild Sophomore campaign. Then, in 2024, he watched his average depth of target fall to just 7.9, the lowest of his college career. He saw his highest slot rate at 81%.

Since the ZAP Model only takes in receiving inputs, Johnson’s Freshman and Sophomore campaigns are worthless to the model.    

Things really turned up in 2024. Not only did Johnson carry the ball 240 times for over 1,500 yards, but he also had 22 receptions for 188 yards through the air.  Because of 2024, Johnson registered a Breakout Score of 75.8.    

Johnson’s 2024 gave him the fourth-highest best-season total yards per team play in the class, and he’s got a top-10 best-season reception share.    

If there’s a downside with Johnson, it’d probably be that his long speed isn’t as desirable as some of the other top backs in the class.

As a Freshman at Ole Miss, Judkins ran the ball 274 times for 1,567 yards and 16 scores.  And he did that on a team that had an NFLer in Zach Evans.  After another successful Sophomore year, Judkins decided to chase a national championship at Ohio State for his third and final college season.  And he, alongside running back teammate TreVeyon Henderson, got it.  As impressive as Judkins’ production was throughout college, the ZAP Model isn’t as in love.  Because his receiving numbers weren’t as good.  Judkins had a best-season reception share of 8.6%, a number acquired during his second year at Mississippi.  He ran about 100 fewer routes than Henderson last season, though the two of them finished the year with a nearly identical yards per route run rate.  Judkins Breakout Score was below average, too, at just 46.5.  The class average Breakout Score is 59.4.  I don’t think Judkins is incapable of being a decent receiving threat in the NFL, but there’s a chance we see him and his size focused more on early-down stuff.

Just 5 of those 60 did it with a best-season receiving yards per team pass attempt rate below 2.0.  One is Tyreek Hill, who we know is an outlier.  Another is Hunter Renfrow, who only gave us one good year.  The other three are Terry McLaurin, Nico Collins, and Ladd McConkey.    

Matthew Golden’s best prorated receiving yards per team pass attempt figure was below 2.0.  It was 1.82, done in 2024, his third and final year of college football.  When we adjust for program strength, his top year in yards per team pass attempt is 2.28, not 1.82.  Those team strength adjustments are a key reason Golden’s Breakout Score is an OK-enough 51.4.    

Golden started his college life at Houston, where he played two seasons and gave us some production.  Receiving yard per team pass attempt rates of 1.38 and 1.32 as a Freshman and Sophomore aren’t tragic.  His top season in yards per route run, per PFF, was 2.10.    

Golden is probably going to get solid draft capital given his ability to create explosive plays.  He's easy to like on film, and his most favorable comparable in the ZAP Model is Ladd McConkey.

That changed as we got closer to the combine, as he was added to the wide receiver list.  No one really knows how Hunter is going to be used at the next level.  Some believe that he'll be a full-time corner who takes some snaps on offense.  If he's a part-time player on offense, then he'll have a hard time living up to his ZAP score.    

His production profile is kind of ordinary for a first-rounder.  His top year in receiving yards per team pass attempt came last season, where it was 2.61.  That's a 20th percentile number among all first-round wide receivers since 2011.  His Breakout Score of 66.9 is a 15th percentile one compared to other first-rounders.  His career yards per route run looks slightly better, but, among first-round wide receivers over the last five seasons, it's still below average.  His yards per route run rate was 2.51 last season.  There are 27 wide receivers in this year's class who had a better rate than that during one of their collegiate seasons.    

We can probably cut Hunter a bit of a break because, you know, he was playing on both offense and defense in college.  None of this is to take away from his insane gifts.  And, to be fair, a lot of evaluators who look solely at film think Hunter is as good as it gets.  If there were no restrictions here -- if we were simply assuming he would play wide receiver -- then I'd more than likely be lower than the market on Hunter.  It's very possible that his metrics aren't showing up well because, again, he did everything for Colorado.  But if we're being completely objective, the predictive metrics we look at aren't close to excellent.",Travis Hunter,Travis Hunter,WR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Travis Hunter,,WR,,12617.0,12530.0,UNK,3114.0,68.0,27.0,-173.0
11,12.0,Tre Harris,WR,6.0,6.0,80.9,Weekly Starter,"Terrance Williams, Cecils Shorts, Cedric Tillman",6'2,205.0,"No wide receiver in this year's draft class has a higher best-season adjusted receiving yards per team pass attempt than Tre Harris.  Harris' final season at Ole Miss was great.  A 60-catch, 1,030-yard campaign may not look like much, but he amassed that in just eight games.  That led to a (prorated) receiving yards per team pass attempt of 3.86.  Harris' yards per route run last year was even crazier.  According to Pro Football Focus, he saw over five yards per route run.  Not only was that by far the highest in this year's class, but it was the highest PFF has ever recorded from a Power Five wideout with 100 or more routes run.  That dates back to 2014.    

As impressive as that is, it wasn't all butterflies and rainbows throughout Harris' college career.  He started things off at Louisiana Tech, where he played three seasons.  There, he failed to really break out until his third year.  He then went to Ole Miss where he had back-to-back seasons of strong production, including his ridiculous 2024.    

We're not usually looking for wide receivers who played five years of college ball.  Younger receivers give us better fantasy football odds.  But, because Harris' numbers were so good at Ole Miss, he ended up with a pretty impressive 83.4 Breakout Score, a top-three number in the class.    

Older players generally don't have upper-tier Breakout Scores in the model.  Since Breakout Score incorporates age, higher scores tend to correlate with at least average-aged prospects.    

Harris is an exception.  Especially when you layer on projected draft capital.    

If Harris gets drafted in the top-100 he's currently forecasted to go in Round 2 then he'll become just the third wideout in ZAP Model history to get picked in the top-100 after turning 23 years old with a Breakout Score above 80. [cite: 4358, 4359, 480.9] The other two?  Sterling Shepard, who had a pretty decent career in the league, and Calvin Ridley.  NFL teams are always looking for perimeter players with decent size.  Harris has that.  And he might be pretty good, too.  He's a higher-variance player to watch.
